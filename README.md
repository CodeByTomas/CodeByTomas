# Hi, I’m Tomas Ramoska

I build small, practical things with code.  
Mostly Python. Mostly on Linux. Usually to automate, simplify, or understand how something really works.

This profile is a record of what I’m learning by **doing**, not theory collecting.

## About Me

- I work primarily with **Python**, focusing on automation, scripting, and small utilities.
- I prefer a **Linux-first**, command-line driven workflow.
- I experiment with **Raspberry Pi and IoT** to learn hardware, networking, and system behavior.
- I value simple solutions, readable code, and tools that do one thing well.

I’m not chasing trends. I’m building fundamentals.

## Current Focus (2026)

- 🔧 **Building**
  - Python automation scripts
  - Small self-hosted tools
  - Raspberry Pi–based monitoring and control projects

- 📚 **Learning Deeper**
  - Python internals and async basics
  - Linux system fundamentals
  - Networking concepts (services, ports, protocols)

- 🧪 **Experimenting**
  - GPIO, sensors, and lightweight IoT setups
  - Docker for local services and repeatable environments
  - GitHub Actions for basic CI

**How I use them:**
- Python for automation, tooling, and experiments
- Bash for glue code and system tasks
- Linux for development, testing, and learning how systems actually behave
- HTML & CSS for simple interfaces, dashboards, and lightweight frontends
- Git for version control and discipline, not just backups

## How I Work

- Prefer simple scripts over heavy frameworks
- Read logs before guessing
- Automate boring or repetitive tasks
- If I don’t understand it, I build a smaller version until I do
